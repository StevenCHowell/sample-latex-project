# Sample LaTeX Project

This repo provides boiler plate code for getting started with a LaTeX project managed using git version control.

## Getting Started

You can edit and update files using any text editor.  To compile the LaTeX file, you will need to install LaTeX onto your system and use the associated compile process.

### Linux Install

Ubuntu flavors of Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

Note that installing `texlive-full` requires approximately 3 GB of storage space.  For a smaller installation, you can also look up options for installing the specific components necessary.

[TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) provides another solid option for compiling LaTeX on Linux.

### Mac Install

```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```
